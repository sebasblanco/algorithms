# Algorithms
 ## Overview
 Welcome to my Algorithms repository! I have uploaded various algorithm implementations in Python and Jupyer Notebooks with the goal to provide clean, efficient, and well-documented code for learning, reference, and problem-solving.  

## Algorithms included

### Data science
Greedy algorithm for optimization

Monte Carlo algorithm for simulations

Linear and Quadratic regressions for comparisons

### Machine Learning
kMeans, kNN, and ANN classifiers for clustering

NLP for sentiment analysis

### Quantum Computing

Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm to determine hidden string

Hamiltonian to find optimal state
